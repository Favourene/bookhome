    Content1: `Ordinary is uninteresting. Either think irrationally, or surround yourself with a few individuals who do. Disruption, creativity, and the sparks that transform the world are all due to these misfits. We take pride in being normal, which is one of the problems with the majority of us. Being that isn't particularly noble. Since most of us have a nearly zero mathematical SD, this presents a hurdle ( Standard Deviation; divergence from the arithmetic mean of our inner circle ). This indicates that you socialize with the same kind of people far too frequently. There’s really nothing to learn from that.`,

      'Winner of the 2021 Sir Walter Raleigh Award for Fiction, Joyce Carol Oates Literary Prize Finalist, 2022 Chautauqua Prize Finalist, Willie Morris Award for Southern Writing Shortlist, and the 2021 Aspen Words Literary Prize shortlist.',
    Content2: `In Jason Mott’s Hell of a Book, a Black author sets out on a cross-country publicity tour to promote his bestselling novel. That storyline drives Hell of a Book and is the scaffolding of something much larger and more urgent: Mott’s novel also tells the story of Soot, a young Black boy living in a rural town in the recent past, and The Kid, a possibly imaginary child who appears to the author on his tour.`,
    Content3: `As these characters’ stories build and converge, they astonish. For while this heartbreaking and magical book entertains and is at once about family, love of parents and children, art and money, it’s also about the nation’s reckoning with a tragic police shooting playing over and over again on the news. And with what it can mean to be Black in America.`,
    Content4: `Who has been killed? Who is The Kid? Will the author finish his book tour, and what kind of world will he leave behind? Unforgettably told, with characters who burn into your mind and an electrifying plot ideal for book club discussion, Hell of a Book is the novel Mott has been writing in his head for the last ten years. And in its final twists, it truly becomes its title.`,
